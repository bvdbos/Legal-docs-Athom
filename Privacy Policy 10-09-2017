If you give your Homey a command to operate the devices that you have connected to your Homey (either by voice, introduced by "Hey, Homey", or by clicking the selected command in the App), Athom uses this command to operate Homey and the connected devices.

Voice command: Your Homey sends the audio file with your voice command to Athom's servers. Athom then sends the audio file to servers of speech recognition operators such as IBM or Wit.ai, who convert the command in the audio file to text. These speech recognition operators may process the audio files for their own purposes (for more information please refer to their privacy policies). This text file is sent back to your Homey, so it can understand your command and execute the command.
